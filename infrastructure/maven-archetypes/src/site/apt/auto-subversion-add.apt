
Automatic Subversion Add

 After running the module creation, an automatic svn add is executed for all
 folders and files of the newly created module. Additionally, and svn:ignore
 property is set for all folders to ignore the folders and/or files: <<target,
 .settings, .classpath, .project>>. As you can see, all eclipse files and
 folders are ignored. They should be automatically created (and <<never 
 commited>>) when you import a module using eclipse maven plugin, which will
 automatically set dependencies and all other eclipse properties when importing.
